      <h3 class="mt-8">Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Information about your computer hardware and software may be
        automatically collected by QMO Lab. This information can include: your
        IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring
        website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the

      <h3 class="mt-8">Use of Cookies</h3>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The QMO Lab website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
        online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
        disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
        deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
        and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
        cookie to you.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
        feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
        server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
        personalize QMO Lab pages, or register with QMO Lab site or services, a
        cookie helps QMO Lab to recall your specific information on subsequent
        visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
        information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
        When you return to the same QMO Lab website, the information you
        previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the QMO Lab
        features that you customized.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the QMO Lab services or websites you visit
